- [hypo-track](https://github.com/StrawberryMaster/hypo-track) - A companion to TrackGen and a fork of the same program by Monsoonjr99. Included here are speed optimizations, support for custom themes, and smaller map sizes for better viewing
- [wayback-machine-downloader](https://github.com/StrawberryMaster/wayback-machine-downloader) - A Wayback Machine downloader, spooky. The functional version of a program with similar name, made in Ruby

- [Liberal Crime Squad](https://github.com/StrawberryMaster/Liberal-Crime-Squad) - My attempt at cleaning up a fork of Liberal Crime Squad. See my fork of the next gen version [here](https://github.com/StrawberryMaster/lcs-new-age)
- [cyclone-sim](https://github.com/StrawberryMaster/cyclone-sim) - A slightly more updated fork of Monsoonjr99's Cyclone Sim. I do random stuff there, may be outdated by the time you see it
